Your HTML page should start with a heading "Show Profile" with a form beneath it.
The form should have a username label, a text field, and a submit button
When the user types a username and either hits enter or clicks the submit button, the profile of the username entered should appear.
The profile should show the resulting user's:
Avatar (if they have one)
Name (if they made that public)
Username (login)
Company (if they have one)
Location (if they have one)
Number of Followers
Number of Following
If the user types another username and submits, that new resulting user's profile should show up
